# Tableau Visualization Recommendations

Consider building the following views (use Tableau filters for interactivity):

- Bar charts of top categories (e.g., protocols, ports, IPs). Use filters to drill down.
- Stacked bars by label across key categories (protocol, port buckets, top IPs).
- Histograms or box plots for numeric distributions (bytes, packets, durations).
- Box plots split by label to spot separability and distribution shifts.
- Tree map or bar chart of port buckets (well-known, registered, dynamic).
- Bar chart of protocol distribution and anomaly rate by protocol.

Add a dashboard tile highlighting class balance and anomaly rate trends.
